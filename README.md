Streamlit-based AI chatbot for a gym trainer in Spain. The main requirements are language selection, user authentication for trainers and clients, schedule management, data storage, notifications, and Excel export.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, the language selection. Streamlit allows dynamic content, so I'll need to use session state to store the selected language and display text accordingly. Maybe a dictionary for translations.

Next, user authentication. Trainers have fixed credentials, so I'll hardcode those. Clients need to create accounts, which should be stored securely. Maybe a JSON file to store usernames, passwords, and roles. For login, check if the user exists and match the password. Session state will track the logged-in user and their role.

Data storage. Each client's data should be separate. Another JSON file, perhaps, where each client has their schedule entries. Trainers can edit or delete any client's data, while clients can only view their own. When a trainer updates a schedule, the client needs a notification. Maybe a 'notifications' field in the client's data.

The schedule creation form. Clients should pick dates from a calendar widget, days from a dropdown, and time maybe with a time input. Streamlit has date_input and selectbox for days. Current date and time can be set as defaults but allow changes.

Notifications. When a trainer updates a schedule, add a message to the client's notifications. Clients should see these upon login and respond with yes/no availability. The trainer can then see the responses.

Excel export. Use pandas to compile all client data into a DataFrame and export to Excel. Trainers can trigger this with a button.

Different interfaces. After login, based on the user's role (trainer or client), display different UIs. Trainers see all clients and can edit, clients see their schedule and notifications.

Security considerations. Storing passwords in plain text is bad. Maybe use hashing, but for simplicity in a prototype, maybe skip it but note the risk. Data files (users.json, clients_data.json) should be created if they don't exist.

Testing each part: language switch, account creation, login, schedule creation, trainer edits, notifications, Excel export.

Possible issues: Concurrent access to JSON files might cause errors. Using file locks or a database would be better, but for simplicity, stick with JSON and hope for low concurrency.

Putting it all together: Start with the language selection, then login/signup. Based on role, show the appropriate interface. Use session state to manage the flow. Functions to handle user data, schedules, and notifications.

Need to make sure the code is well-structured, uses functions for repetitive tasks, and handles edge cases like missing files or incorrect logins.
